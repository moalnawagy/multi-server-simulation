# multi-server-simulation
Consider a computer technical support center where personnel take calls and
provide service. There are two technical support people – Able and Baker (multi
server system). Able is more experienced and can provide service faster than
Baker. Rule: “Able gets the call if both technical support people are idle”. The
distribution of times between customer arrivals and the service times are shown in
table.
Inter-arrival time  0  2  4  4  2  2
Service time        5  3  3  5  6  3
a) Suggest other performance measures that could be used to evaluate the
system.
b) Specify: Sate variables, Entities, Events, and Activities you will use to
describe the system
c) Draw the event diagram for you simulation.
d) Simulate the system. Make sure you clearly show the simulation clock and the
event list.
e) Calculate the Average waiting time of those who wait in queue d(n).
f) Calculate the Time-average number in queue q(n).
1g) Calculate the total busy time B(t)
h) Calculate the utilization u(n) of the server.
i) Calculate the average service time.
j) Calculate the average waiting time.
k) Calculate the average time customer spends in the system.
l) Calculate the Throughput.

then Repeat the simulation In case that Able is alone (without Baker)
